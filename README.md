A "Light Calculator" that counts the number of times a PB is pressed. The amount is then divided by a pre-set number "5". The result is displayed by a LED blinking sequence.
The remainder is shown in binary on the bottom LEDs.

The program picks up on the last LED and displays the quotient of a different number "9" with the remainder in binary.

KITT LED lights were programmed as the creative portion when the calculations are finished.
